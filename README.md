<!--
**The Industrial Grade Termux Framework.**

This is not just a theme. It is a complete environment takeover. It automates Zsh, Powerlevel10k, Nerd Fonts, and custom tools into a unified system.

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️

**READ BEFORE INSTALLING:**

1.  **This tool takes control of your `~/.zshrc` file.**
2.  Your existing `.zshrc` will be **automatically backed up** to your internal storage (`~/storage/shared/1llicit/backup/`). It is not deleted.
3.  However, the active `.zshrc` will be replaced by the 1llicit
4. **Do not edit `.zshrc` directly anymore.** Updates will overwrite it.

**Where to put your custom stuff:**
*   Use `~/.zshenv` for environment variables.
*   Use `~/.1llicit/user.zsh` for personal aliases (this file survives updates).
*   Use `~/.bashrc` if you want to keep using Bash separately.

**If you agree to these terms, proceed.**

---

###  Installation

Copy and paste this one-line command into Termux:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://lbslightx.github.io/1llicit/install.sh)"
```

---

### How to Use

Once installed, you have access to the **1ll-** suite of tools. Type them in your terminal to launch.

*   **`1ll-colors`** - Browse and install 370+ color schemes instantly.
*   **`1ll-fonts`** - Install Nerd Fonts without manual downloading.
*   **`1ll-syntax`** - Change your syntax highlighting theme.
*   **`1ll-update`** - Update the core framework from 1llicit GitHub repository.
*   **`1ll-backup`** - Create a full snapshot of your shell config in Downloads.
*   **`1ll-config`** - Restore your custom `termux.properties` (keys/settings).

---

###  Customization

To add your own aliases, functions, or exports that survive updates, create this file:

```bash
touch ~/.1llicit/user.zsh
nano ~/.1llicit/user.zsh
``` 

Anything you write in `user.zsh` is loaded automatically on startup.

---

###  Uninstallation

If you want to go back to normal, run this command. It will restore your previous configuration if a backup exists.

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://LbsLightX.github.io/1llicit/uninstall.sh)"
```
